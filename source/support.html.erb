<h2>Support</h2>
<p>
If you're having trouble using Vagrant, want general advice,
think you may have found a bug, or want to get in touch with
a human being for any reason, there are various support channels
available.

<p>
Professional support packages are on the way. In the mean time,
the Vagrant community is very helpful and can provide assistance.
If you need professional assistance right away, please

<h2>Community Support</h2>

are more than happy to assist newcomers and veterans alike.</p>

<p>
<strong>IRC:</strong> <code>#vagrant</code> on Freenode. IRC
provides a real-time chat environment for getting help. Note that
the quality and availability of assistance depends largely on the
time of day and who is currently active in the channel.
